# "Closures, Scope, and Execution Context" challenges
Challenge 1
Create a function createFunction that creates and returns a function. When that created function is called, it should print "hello". When you think you completed createFunction, un-comment out those lines in the code and run it to see if it works.

Challenge 2
Create a function createFunctionPrinter that accepts one input and returns a function. When that created function is called, it should print out the input that was used when the function was created.

Challenge 3
Examine the code for the outer function. Notice that we are returning a function and that function is using variables that are outside of its scope.
Uncomment those lines of code. Try to deduce the output before executing. Now we are going to create a function addByX that returns a function that will add an input by x.

Challenge 4
Write a function once that accepts a callback as input and returns a function. When the returned function is called the first time, it should call the callback and return that output. If it is called any additional times, instead of calling the callback again it will simply return the output value from the first time it was called.

Challenge 5
Write a function after that takes the number of times the callback needs to be called before being executed as the first parameter and the callback as the second parameter.

Challenge 6
Write a function delay that accepts a callback as the first parameter and the wait in milliseconds before allowing the callback to be invoked as the second parameter. Any additional arguments after wait are provided to func when it is invoked. HINT: research setTimeout();

Challenge 7
Write a function rollCall that accepts an array of names and returns a function. The first time the returned function is invoked, it should log the first name to the console. The second time it is invoked, it should log the second name to the console, and so on, until all names have been called. Once all names have been called, it should log 'Everyone accounted for'.

Challenge 8
Create a function saveOutput that accepts a function (that will accept one argument), and a string (that will act as a password). saveOutput will then return a function that behaves exactly like the passed-in function, except for when the password string is passed in as an argument. When this happens, the returned function will return an object with all previously passed-in arguments as keys, and the corresponding outputs as values.

Challenge 9
Create a function cycleIterator that accepts an array, and returns a function. The returned function will accept zero arguments. When first invoked, the returned function will return the first element of the array. When invoked a second time, the returned function will return the second element of the array, and so forth. After returning the last element of the array, the next invocation will return the first element of the array again, and continue on with the second after that, and so forth.

Challenge 10
Create a function defineFirstArg that accepts a function and an argument. Also, the function being passed in will accept at least one argument. defineFirstArg will return a new function that invokes the passed-in function with the passed-in argument as the passed-in function's first argument. Additional arguments needed by the passed-in function will need to be passed into the returned function.

Challenge 11
Create a function dateStamp that accepts a function and returns a function. The returned function will accept however many arguments the passed-in function accepts, and return an object with a date key that contains a timestamp with the time of invocation, and an output key that contains the result from invoking the passed-in function. HINT: You may need to research how to access information on Date objects.

Challenge 12
Create a function censor that accepts no arguments. censor will return a function that will accept either two strings, or one string. When two strings are given, the returned function will hold onto the two strings as a pair, for future use. When one string is given, the returned function will return the same string, except all instances of first strings (of saved pairs) will be replaced with their corresponding second strings (of those saved pairs).

Challenge 13
There's no such thing as private properties on a JavaScript object! But, maybe there are? Implement a function createSecretHolder(secret) which accepts any value as secret and returns an object with ONLY two methods. getSecret() which returns the secret setSecret() which sets the secret.

Challenge 14
Write a function, callTimes, that returns a new function. The new function should return the number of times itâ€™s been called.
